Production Failures Are Complex and Cascading

    One minor, unhandled exception (a SQL error during database failover) caused a total system crash.

    Small bugs in production can ripple across systems due to tight coupling.

Error Handling Must Be Defensive and Realistic

    The system did not expect this specific failure mode, and when it hit, it froze instead of failing gracefully.

    Lesson: Always expect failure at integration points like databases, queues, APIs, etc.

Test for Real-World Failures

    The scenario that caused the failure had not been tested in staging or pre-production.

    Lesson: If your tests only validate the happy path, you’re not testing production reality.

Timeouts Are Non-Negotiable

    The system had no timeout on its database calls, so it waited indefinitely.

    Lesson: Always use timeouts on external resource calls to prevent indefinite hangs.

Isolation Prevents Cascading Failures

    A single service failure took down multiple other systems.

    Lesson: Use bulkheads (isolation), circuit breakers, and other stability patterns to limit blast radius.

You Can’t Assume Everything Will Work

    The system was designed under the assumption that certain failures would never happen.

    Lesson: Don’t trust ideal conditions. Systems must behave safely when things break — because they will.
